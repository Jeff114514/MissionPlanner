main.py and myMain.py make use of the same data structure, but main.py is the original code and myMain.py is my code.

The original code is from https://gitlab.buaanlsde.cn/loujiabin/mission-planner/-/tree/main and cannot deal with some cases. So I modified it, if you want to get the original code, you can go to the link above.

For using this code, you can:
1. run run.py to get the comparison of the original code and my code
2. run main.py or myMain.py to get the result by
   ```python main.py numNodes numTrucks```
